# TextZero

TextZero is a search algorithm on top of a LLM (as of now: GPT-2). It is similar to the AlphaGo architecture. We have policy (the LLM), value (trained to distinguish between real and generated datapoints) and modified MCTS search tree. The idea is that with described modifications we can approach the text generation exactly as in game playing and take advantage of algorithms developed to master the games such as Go and Chess. Currently we use pretrained policy without any self-play, however in theory there is nothing stopping us from post-training or even training the policy network entirely from scratch using the rolled-out targets of MCTS tree. We note that one problem with the approach is that the time complexity is much bigger than in classical autoregressive decoding because one needs to generate text number of times equal to number of rollouts.
